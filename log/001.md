# The beginning

So I though that building just a simple library to parse the bitmap and batch
the bit fields would be too simple.

Let's take it up a notch and make it a d* app that renders a simple radar UI,
tracks invaders and beeps expressively from time to time to appear cooler
than it is.

Haven't really done anything serious with datastar yet, so it's going to be
an interesting project.

## Goals

* a GUI
* invader detector, naive, just weighted pattern matching
* beeps, lots of beeps, at least three beeps
* radar data generator

### Design inspo:

Volvo recently released a new custom font. So I kinda liked the typography-heavy,
minimal UI design of the dashboard. So naturally this is the way the radar UI
should look like.

## Nice-to-haves

* canvas based radar renderer
* target tracking

## Non-goals

* responsive layout
* invader detection regardless of scale and rotation (definitely not doing SIFT here)
* performance optimizations (not trying to be too clever, so there will not be any
  binary data wrangling)
