# Radar noise

Added simple radar reading generation. Felt like the app was incomplete without
it. It now generates a new noisy radar scan image with a bunch of randomly
placed invaders.

Issues:
* I have no idea how async datastar handlers are, but apparently async enough to
  not let changes propagate to an atom. So I had to do some `Thread/sleep`
  in order for everything to work.
* Lack of architecture starts to show. There's multiple ways data is pushed to the
  browser (click event handler and file system watcher). This will cause diverging
  state if you start editing invaders and/or radar data manually. I will update the
  canvas and the invaders display, but it will not trigger threat scan.
  Oh well. It's enough for debugging so I'll have to live with it.
