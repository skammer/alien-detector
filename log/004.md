# Feature creep is real

Ok I think this is getting ridiculous. Had lots of fun with it but I kinda
need to end it somewhere.

Crosshair now displays the selected detection target. Everything renders
acceptably fast thanks to async nature of callbacks and parallel execution
and lazy sequences.

Would be interesting to make a game out of it. Maybe a multiplayer one!
