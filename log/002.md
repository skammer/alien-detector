# Detection algorithm

1. pad nils around the scanner output matrix so that bottom bits of the aliens
   can be matched
2. walk row by row, column by column, checking if invader template matrix
   matches underlying scan section
3. if match score exceeds the threshold, increase match matrix values for current
   matching chunk location
4. the initial idea was to draw some sort of heat map, but with low threshold
   there's too many false positives. So it's going to be a very flat heat map
   for the time being
